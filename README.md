# cancer-cell-semantic-segmentation
PyTorch implementation of several CNNs for segmentation of cancer cells.
# Requirement
Python 3.6.4

PyTorch 0.4.0

Some other libraries: NumPy 1.14.0, SciPy 1.0.0, Matpotlib 2.1.2

I recommend installation of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) with CUDA using [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/), which includes most of the libraries required. For example, Linux users can run the following command in the terminal:
```
conda install pytorch torchvision cuda91 -c pytorch
```

(This is my environment, but others may also work)
