# cancer-cell-semantic-segmentation
PyTorch implementation of several CNNs for segmentation of cancer cells.
# Requirement
Python 3.6.4

PyTorch 0.4.0

Some other libraries: NumPy 1.14.0, SciPy 1.0.0, Matpotlib 2.1.2

I recommend installation of PyTorch with CUDA using Anaconda3, which includes most of the libraries required.

(This is my environment, but other verions may also work)
